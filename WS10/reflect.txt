In workshop 10 I have learnt more about Template. By using the provided modules, I had to create a search function using Template. The code was very straight forward and easy as the provided modules already included the overloaded operator == for us to match (using strstr, which is a new function from the lib I have learnt as well) and the add() function to push the search result into a new collection array.

The most difficult part is to figure out the syntax of the search signature because typename T is a new things we have just learnt.

For the milestone 5, I spent less time on it compare to most of the milestone 1-4 because most of the frameworks were done already in past month. It took me on and off around 1.5 days to finish the coding part. However, the most challenging part was to debug because there were memory leak for sure and to delete dynamic memory for array of pointers was more complicated and confusing. I have been deleting all the things I have used "new" and as an experiment I had tons of errors coming out in the valgrind compiler saying invalid read or write etc due to I deleted certain memory block which were going to be used. The loadData() function took most of the time to write as well to debug. After that, I have figured out my deallocation did not include the array of pointer which caused the memory leak as well.

I have learnt more on debugging to find out and fix the errors one by one using valgrind.
