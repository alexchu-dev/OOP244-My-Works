# Reflect for WS02P2
While doing this workshop, I have watched the recorded lecture from week 1 to week 3 again and studied the oop244 course notes, with the help with Google to search for extra tutorial documents from cplusplus and stackoverflow etc.

I have learnt how to allocate and deallocate memory manually, learnt about what is memory leak and how we can avoid it. It is a good practise that in this workshop we have more than a thousand of records so we use DMA for it. Also, I learnt about assigning nullptr at the beginning and at the end of the scope so that it is safe. For overloading, it is still difficult for me because I found it is confusing sometimes when the functions have the same name and it is difficult to apply to case. For referencing, it makes the codes tidier and use less memory space because we can reference to the alias directly.

While Pointers with Structs was one of the most difficult/confusing topic in IPC, topping up DMA, referencing and overloading in OOP and all together in one workshop is a nightmare. Although I am still not very confident in these, but I started trying to draw flowcharts before coding helps a little bit. Still, the syntax and those * and & moving around in definition and declaration especially calling each other in different modules causing so much confusion and always there are no syntax errors but when I compile and run it, semantic errors are always hiding somewhere. Nevertheless, if we can digest most of the concept then this workshop is not too difficult but it was very frustrating when it was a loop of struggle. I personally think the first 3 weeks as beginner is super tough, we got no time to digest and tons of super important information throwing in. I will have to keep revising these few topics to get efficiency.
